            <h1> Native Pollinators</h1>
            <p>Primary animal pollinators include ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, flies, birds, hummingbirds and moths.</p>
          <p>Populations of many pollinator species like bees, butterflies and bats (yes, they're pollinators too!) have been negatively impacted by agricultural practices such as using synthetic pesticides, disease and habitat loss. These creatures are experiencing a drastically different world compared to just a few decades ago.

            Native pollinators depend on native plants to provide habitat and food, and plants need pollinators to help them reproduce. In fact, pollinators assist in the reproduction of 75% of flowering plants worldwide. THAT'S HUGE!
            
            So, if we turn our manicured lawns that provide little to nothing for pollinators into havens full of native flowers and wild grasses, we will effectively "generate some buzz" and bring back these essential workers full force</p>
